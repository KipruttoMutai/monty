0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
0. push, pall
Implement the push and pall opcodes.
- The opcode push pushes an element to the stack
- The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack

1. pint
Implement the pint opcode.
- The pint opcode
- The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

2. Pop
Implement the pop opcode.
- The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

3. Swap
Implement the swap opcode.
- The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

4. add
Implement the add opcode.
- The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

5. Nope 
Implement the nop opcode.
- The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.

6. Implement the sub opcode.
- The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.

7. Div
Implement the div opcode
- The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

8. Mul
Implement the mul opcode.
- The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.

9. The mod opcode
- The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

10 . Comments
- Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).

11. The pchar opcode
- The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

12. The pstr opcode
- The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

13. The rotl opcode
- The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.

14. The rotr opcode
- The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.

15. The stack opcode
- The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default behavior of the program.

16. Brainfuck
- Write a Brainf*ck script that prints School, followed by a new line.

17. Add 2 digits
- Add two digits given by the user.

18. Multiplication
- Multiply two digits given by the user.

19. Multiplication Level up
- Multiply two digits given by the user.
